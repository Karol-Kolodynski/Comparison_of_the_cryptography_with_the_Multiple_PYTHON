# 🐍 CryptoThreads-Python

A testing platform written in **Python** to test the performance of cryptographic algorithms (AES, RSA) and multithreaded text processing. The project allows the analysis of execution time, CPU and RAM consumption in different scenarios.

---

## 📘 Project description

The aim of the project is to evaluate the capabilities of the Python language for:
- encryption and decryption of data,
- multithreaded text processing,
- measuring resource consumption (time, CPU, RAM),
- comparison of results in different configurations.

## 🔍 Functionality

## 🛡 Cryptographic mode:
- Support for encryption and decryption using AES and RSA,
- Possibility to provide custom text or generate random data,
- Configuration: number of passwords, text length, key length.

### 🔄 Multi-threaded text processing mode:
- Search for keywords in a text file,
- Possibility to set the number of threads, words to search for and input file,
- Reporting of results and running times.

### 📊 Performance measurement:
- Execution time,
- CPU and RAM consumption.
